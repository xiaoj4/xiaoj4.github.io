## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
The prompt of this project was to design or redesign a digital product that would allow one to interact in a more effective, easy, or fun way with an activity that the designer normally participates in. In my case, I chose to design a meditation and mental health tracker app. As stated, this app serves as a meditation tool with timers and a community function that allows one to meditate with others. This app is designed with a fun aspect in mind with a pet-raising-game function.
