## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
_How Do You Game?_ is a thesis project on the gendered gaming experience. While open to all gender, there is more of a focus on the gender discrimination against non-cis-male members of the gaming community in order to spread more awareness.

## DESIGN PROCESS
The foundation of this project rests on the answers I recieved from a questionnaire that was conducted from Novemeber 2022 to Februrary 2023. The used answers were then edited slightly for grammatical or clarity reasons. This questionnaire allowed those who wish to share their gendered gaming experience to use for this project. 

There are multiple parts to this project that include a one-page zine, a digital zine, a poster, and a social media profile. The questionnaire answers were used as content for the one-page zine and the digital zine. The one-page zine has the same, but less content than the digital zine and serves as a more condensed version that can be easily printed, folded, and viewed. Those who are interested in reading more are directed to the digital zine from the one-page zine. The social media profile acts as hub for each of the parts to be accessed. The poster is a portion that aids the content of the zines that centers on "gamer etiquette" meant to be printed and hung up.
