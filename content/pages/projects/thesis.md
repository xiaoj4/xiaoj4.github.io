**THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN-PROGRESS AND WILL BE EDITED AS IT IS UPDATED

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
How Do You Game? is a thesis project on the gender discrimination within the gaming community. This is a topic that is close to my heart as a woman who has been subjected to attitude changes solely based on my gender that affects my gaming experience. This project is to create a space where I am able to share gendered gaming experiences that other discriminated gamers have shared with me.

## DESIGN PROCESS
The foundation of this project rests on the answers I recieved from a questionnaire that was conducted from Novemeber 2022 to Februrary 2023. The used answers were then edited slightly for grammatical or clarity reasons. This questionnaire allowed those who wish to share their gendered gaming experience to use for this project. 

There are multiple parts to this project that include a one-page zine, a digital zine, a poster, and a social media profile. The questionnaire answers were used as content for the one-page zine and the digital zine. The one-page zine has the same, but less content than the digital zine and serves as a more condensed version that can be easily printed, folded, and viewed. Those who are interested in reading more are directed to the digital zine from the one-page zine. The social media profile acts as hub for each of the parts to be accessed. The poster is a portion that aids the content of the zines that centers on "gamer etiquette" meant to be printed and hung up.
