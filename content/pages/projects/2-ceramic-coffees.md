## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
Ceramic Coffees is a branding project for a cafe and bakery themed establishment. As an academical project, this is a purely fictional establishment and business. 

## DESIGN PROCESS
This project has deliverables that includes logo, menu, business system (stationary), website and more. 

This project involves intense research and exploration of similar establishments to create the theme and feel for the design.

The logo is a result of countless variations and type exploration. The brand mark is a coffee cup on top of a pottery turn table that is reminiscent of a coaster.
