## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
_Our Happy Places_ is a design research exercise conducted in Spring 2022. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as a foundation, we were to select a topic that matters to us, conduct research, and ultimately design a poster that shares the outcomes of our work. 

SDG #3 is on "Good Health and Well-Being" which also encompasses the topic of mental health.
