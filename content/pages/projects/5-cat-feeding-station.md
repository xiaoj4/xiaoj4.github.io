## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
This cat feeding station is a project on adapting an object for use. The object chosen is the metal cat bowl featured in the first picture. This object is to-size and functional (currently, in use!) with the help of 3D printing. 

While being at an appropriate height for a cat to crouch and eat, the top portion is also at an angle that allows for the cat to comfortably eat. The bottom portion is designed as a storage that can also be used as a slot to weigh down the feeding station.
