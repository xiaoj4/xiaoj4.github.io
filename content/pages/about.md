# ABOUT{.page-title}

Hello! I'm Maggie Xiao and I'm a graphic designer who is interested in UI/UX- specifically pertaining to the game design industry. As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, I have spent the past few years learning and honing skills to aid me in the field. I am excited to be able to use my expertise in helping businesses and individuals to communicate their message through effective visual design.

When I'm not working on my design projects, you can find me baking goodies, enjoying tea while reading, or being terrible at video games with my friends. Although, I'm not the best, due to my enjoyment of video games, I have great interest for game design. I enjoy having a graphic designer's perspective of the game's interfaces and interactions with players such as myself and thus have even greater appreciation for the designer behind it. Whilst relaxing and enjoying my hobby, it's pretty awesome to me that I can learn what makes good UI/UX by having personal user experience.
